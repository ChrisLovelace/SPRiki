# SPRiki
A recreation of the Wiki project from https://github.com/alexanderjulo/wiki. From Python and Flask to Java using Spring Boot.

The idea for this project came as I was learning Spring boot, and I remembered there was a wiki project that was used as an example in one of my SE classes in college.
My goal here was just to learn more about Flask and Spring, as well as python and Java through recreating the project to feature parity. 

Almost all focus is on the backend functionality, so html and css is slightly modified from the already modified version of the wiki project we used in class. I wanted to make it work as closely to the original as possible, so all credit to the original creator.

All html has been altered to use thymeleaf integration with the backend, much of it is done to allow the reuse of the existing css and javascript where possible. The layout of the project in the backend is very similar to the original, but the implementation of the methods and logic is different and original according to what was necessary with the differences in how the frameworks and languages themselves work. One such example is the inclusion of return types for methods, since this is a key attribute of Java that works entirely differently in Python.
