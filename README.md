# SPRiki
A recreation of the Wiki project from https://github.com/alexanderjulo/wiki. From Python and Flask to Java using Spring Boot.

The idea for this project came as I was learning Spring boot, and I remembered there was a wiki project that was used as an example in one of my SE classes in college.
My goal here was just to learn more about Flask and Spring, as well as python and Java through recreating the project to feature parity. 

Almost all focus is on the functionality and backend, so html and css is copied and slightly modified from the already modified version of the wiki project we used in class. I wanted to make it work as closely ot the original as possible, so all credit to the original creator.
