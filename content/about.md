This is a recreation of the [Wiki](https://github.com/alexanderjulo/wiki) project from github.com/alexanderjulo, a modified version of which was used in one of my CS classes in college. The original was made with Python and Flask, and this project is done in Java with Spring Boot, hence the name.

<br>

The idea for this project came as I remembered the example project used in my CS classes while I was learning Spring. My goal here was to become proficient in the use of the Spring framework to create web applications, and to brush up on my knowledge of Flask in the process.

<br>

Almost all focus is on using Spring boot for the backend functionality, so the frontend html, css, and javascript is just a version of the original frontend that I modified to use the new backend. The final setup of the frontend templates is somewhat strange due to modifying a set of Flask/Jinja templates to Spring/Thymeleaf, but the end result is functional and can be modified and expanded relatively easily.

<br>

The layout of the project in the backend is very similar to the original, but the implementation of the methods and logic is different and original according to what was necessary with the differences in how the frameworks and languages themselves work.
