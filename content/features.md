### Work In Progress
In its current state the project reflects all features of the original aside from user functionality. This does mean that any who access this site can edit and delete pages at will, but the way login and user functionality was done in the original was very simple and I plan to expand on this if I do explore that feature.

#### These include:
* The use of [markdown](/page/markdown) for page formatting.
* The ability to [create](/create), edit, and delete pages.
* The ability to preview changes on a page before saving.
* An [Index page](/index) that lists all currently existing pages.
* A [Tags index](/tags) that lists all tags and allows you to see the number of pages with a particular tag.
* The ability to list all pages that have a particular tag.
* A [Search page](/search) that allows the user to search for existing pages by keyword in the title or tags using regex.
