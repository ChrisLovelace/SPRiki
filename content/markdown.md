This project uses the [Java commonmark library](https://github.com/commonmark/commonmark-java) to translate markdown pages to HTML, which is key for this project.

This markdown library works differently to the python markdown library that was used in the original wiki project, and influenced most of the changes in the way that pages are processed.

#### [Markdown Style Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax)

Most of what is in the guide should work on this site, though there are some specifics like spacing between '#' characters for headers and the use of html style line breaks rather than whitespace breaks.
